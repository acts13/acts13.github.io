As I write and create, Iâ€™m hopeful to open eyes, hearts, and minds. It surprises me that so many people are unwilling to change. But, then again, I find myself often times unwilling to change as well. It turns that what I want most in myself is what I want most in others too. 



The *difference* is that I give myself **grace** that I would never give to another.
